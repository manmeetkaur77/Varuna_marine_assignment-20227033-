## What I Learned Using AI Agents
Working with AI agents was a completely new experience that taught me how to combine automation with logical thinking. Instead of treating the agent as a code generator, I learned to use it like a teammate — asking questions, refining prompts, and cross-checking outputs. It pushed me to think more clearly about what I wanted to build, since the quality of results depended entirely on how I structured my requests. I also learned how to debug collaboratively with the agent, which made me more confident in tracing and understanding complex frontend-backend interactions.

## Efficiency Gains vs Manual Coding
The speed difference was huge. Tasks that normally took hours — like setting up React pages, API routes, or styling layouts — could be done in minutes with an AI agent. However, I realized that pure speed isn’t everything. The agent often produced near-perfect boilerplate code but needed manual review to ensure correctness, readability, and consistency with my existing project structure. So, the real gain wasn’t just in faster coding, but in how much time I saved on setup and repetitive logic, allowing me to focus more on debugging and understanding core functionality.

## Improvements for Next Time
Next time, I’d spend more time refining my prompt engineering and maintain a structured workflow — clearly separating brainstorming, coding, and validation steps. I’d also automate version tracking of AI-generated code using Git branches, so I can better measure what worked and what didn’t. Another key improvement would be to combine multiple agents strategically — for example, using Claude for debugging explanations and Copilot for inline suggestions — to balance creativity with precision. Overall, this project made me appreciate how AI can amplify a developer’s efficiency when used thoughtfully.
